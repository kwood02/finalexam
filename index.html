      <p>School Shootings in America have been far too frequent over the last 20+ years. Dating back to 1999, school shootings have been on the rise with no feasible solution to get them to decrease or at least slow up how rapidly it has been increasing. The analysis of data showed represents the number of casualties from school shootings since 2013, a decade from this year. The most recent school shooting that caught the attention of those around the world was the planned attack on the Christian School in Nashville, Tennesee and the Covenant Presbyterian church, which is attached. This most recent shootings took the lives of 3 children as well as 3 adults. The former student, Audrey Hale, had planned this attack for months and acted completely alone while studying other mass murderers prior to this massacre. One of the most saddening massacres occurring in 2018 was the Santa Fe High School shooting in Houston,Texas that killed 10 people and injured 14. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the mentally incompetent shooter responsibel for the livees of 10 at Santa Fe High School, was charged with capital murder after this attack but has yet to serve jail time as the judge saw it fit for him to stay in a hospital until he was mentally capable of withstandign trial. Despite Pagourtzis’s mental illness or Hale’s motive or lack thereof or anyone else’s reasoning behind such brutal acts, these are repeatitive attacks on innocent lives.</p>
<p>I spoke with the Public Safety Detective for the Department of Public Safety at Syracuse University, Michael J Toia about the increase of school shootings and like many others, he believes there needs to be a stop to this. People in America continue fighting for children who are at risk for something like this to happen to them, yet there are laws in place that are not strict enough to prevent things liek this to happen. When asked about whether or not schools shootings have unfortunately become a norm, Mr. Toia said, “You never become desensitized to school shootings especially when young innocent students and teacher are becoming statistics to unnecessary violence. Never the norm. It’s incomprehensible.” While he may never feel desensitized to situations like this, others have and they’ve done less and less to stopo them and feel less and less when they hear the news of another one. America is slowly becoming desensitized to heartbreaking situations. Not even regarding solely school shootings but racially motivated massacres like the one that occurred at the Tops Marketplace in Buffalo, NY just a year ago or the countless cases of police discrimination with names that so many know; Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, and so many more. Rightfully so, Americans are beginning to have no optimism that things will change, because they haven’t for so many years.</p>

  <p>When speaking with Mr. Toia, he said that in order to try to decrease the number of casualties as well as the school shootings occurring in the first place are enforcing a universal law when it comes to guns; “There are far too many guns on the streets..stricter gun laws need to be imposed.” According to my data analysis and the data found from the Washington Post, the deadliest weapon used in school shootings was the Smith and Wesson M&P15. The Smith and Wesson is a semi-automatic rifle that was used to kill 17 innocent people during school shootings within the last decade, according to the data.The access that the majority have to gun licenses and weapons is far beyond one to ensure that lives could not be unnecessarily taken by reckless and unjust behavior. This does not only apply to school shootings, however, as it applies to any mass shooting involving guns, rifles, etc. The BMJ states that with, “more relaxed gun control laws and higher rates of gun ownership…” there are, as a result, “higher rates of mass shootings..” (BMJ 2019) A universal law, in Mr. Toia’s opinion would decrease some of the mass shootings we have seen in our recent years. Being on a college campus dealing with petty thefts, robberies and stolen cars, for the most part,  allows Mr. Toia to have an outside-in perspective on what should happen to try and alleviate some of this pain and suffering from these brutal attacks. From any position, whether it is on campus at a University or the Chief of Staff at the FBI, massacres that impact young children impact everyone no matter your involvement on how to resolve it. </p>
<p>Throughout the last 10 years, Texas has been at the forefront of people lost due to reckless acts such as a school shooting. As Mr. Toia passionately wrote to me, there must be a change in how our laws reflect our country. The laws in place as of now are not effective in trying to prevent more things like this to happen, rather encouraging the act. Stricter gun laws must be put in place as the first step to trying to get a handle on impacting young children's lives. The unfortunate thought of a child going to school with every intention to make it back home to their families and not being able to, has become a reality that America has come to live with.</p>
